# Data directory

This simply contains some sample data that represents fictional datacenter sites and fictional machine information that is contained in those sites.

Two subdirectories are contained here:
* `generators/` contains programs that are used to generate these data files
* `packages/` contains packages that access these data files

In the real world the data would be in some service that you query for this information. But for our purposes, this gives us some fake data to be able to generate work to do.
